# Magic: the Gathering Price Checker

## Project Summary

Many Magic: the Gathering (MTG) players are concerned about the prices of cards, especially because card prices are arbitrary, fluctuate widely, and change often. For example, card prices tend to range from $0.25 to $50.00 or more, with some worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars, and a card that costs $1.00 today could cost $20.00 next month, or vice versa.

This program is a tool that MTG players could use to efficiently price out a list of cards without having to manually look up each one, a process that can be very time-consuming if theyâ€™re interested in the prices of many different cards.

The program pulls current price data from Face to Face Games (https://www.facetofacegames.com/), a Canadian online retailer.

NOTE: This program can only find prices for near-mint non-foil cards; however, it _should_ work for special versions of cards such as alternate art and borderless.
